# Sort Algorithm

## Preface

In this chapter, I want to summarize the sort algorithm. As we all know, there are 10 common sort algorithms. And I don't want to do too much foreshadowing. Let's see a picture straight.

| **Heap Sort**      | O(n*logn)           | O(1)                 | Unstable      | In-place           | O(n*logn)     | O(n*logn)      |

In the next sections, I will talk about them respectively.

## 10 Common Sort Algorithms

### Insertion Sort

This is an intuitive algorithm.

Given a collection of integers, you can sort the list by proceeding from the start of the list. 

In every round, you will encounter an element that is out of order, and you can continuously swap places with previous elements until it is inserted in its correct relative location based on what youâ€™ve processed thus far.

Here is the dynamic proceeding:

![Insertion Sort](https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/xustudyxu/image-hosting1@master/20221119/insertionSort.lre9a3i98xs.gif)

Here is the code:

``` ts
function insertSort(nums: number[]): void {
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const current = nums[i];
    let j = i - 1;
    while (j >= 0 && nums[j] >= current) {
      nums[j + 1] = nums[j];
      j--;
    }
    nums[j + 1] = current;
  }
}

// test
const array = [5, 3, 1, 2, 4];
insertSort(array);
console.log(array);
```

It is a stable algorithm because the sequence of other elements doesn't change during the period of each sorting round.

Obviously, the time complexity is O(n^2). And it's an in-place algorithm, so the space complexity is O(1).

### Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort, a really interesting name, is another common sort algorithm. And it is easy to remember because of its name.

Given a collection of integers.

In every round, each adjacent element, from beginning to end sequentially, will compare their value and swap if they are out of order.

The core idea of bubble sort is it will repeat this process until no more swaps are made in a single pass, which means the list is sorted.

Here is the dynamic proceeding:

![Bubble Sort](https://cdn.staticaly.com/gh/xustudyxu/image-hosting1@master/20221129/bubbleSort.60l6mgy53080.gif)

Here is the code:

```ts
function bubbleSort(nums: number[]): void {
  // i represent the number of round
  for (let i = nums.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    // in each round, we can put a max number at the end
    // so the next round, this last index don't need to participate in sort
    for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
      if (nums[j] > nums[j + 1]) {
        const temp = nums[j];
        nums[j] = nums[j + 1];
        nums[j + 1] = temp;
      }
    }
  }
}

// test
const array = [10, 1, 3, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6];
bubbleSort(array);
console.log(array);
```

It is a stable algorithm because the sequence of other elements doesn't change during the period of each sorting round.

Obviously, the time complexity is O(n^2). And it's an in-place algorithm, so the space complexity is O(1).

### Selection Sort

It is another intuitive algorithm and it is easy to realize.

Given a collection of integers.

In every round, find the minimum element in that list and move it to the front of the list through a swap. That's it!

Here is the dynamic proceeding:

![Selection Sort](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/2020070819571632.gif)

Here is the code:

``` ts
function selectionSort(nums: number[]) {
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    let min = i;
    for (let j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
      if (nums[min] > nums[j]) {
        min = j;
      }
    }
    const temp = nums[i];
    nums[i] = nums[min];
    nums[min] = temp;
  }
}

// test
const array = [10, 1, 3, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6];
selectionSort(array);
console.log(array);
```

It is not a stable algorithm because the sequence of other elements is broken during the period of each sorting round.

Obviously, the time complexity is O(n^2). And it's an in-place algorithm, so the space complexity is O(1).

### Counting Sort

These 3 sorting methods above are simple and intuitive. And now we start to learn some advanced sort algorithms.

Counting Sort is clever. 

Consider we have a collection of integers. We can record the number of each integer. And then, we get a count array so that we can calculate the sorted index of this collection of integers. It's awesome!

Here is the dynamic proceeding:

![Counting Sort](https://pic4.zhimg.com/v2-3c7ddb59df2d21b287e42a7b908409cb_b.webp)

::: tip Hint
However, a key assumption of counting sort is that the minimum possible value in the array is 0 (no negative numbers) and the maximum value is some positive integer K.

So if your array includes some negative numbers, please remember to do a map that keeps all numbers are positive.

For example, an array with values between -5 and 10 can be mapped to values between 0 and 15, perform counting sort, and then remap to the original -5 to 10 range.

This is important!
:::

Here is the code:

``` ts
function countingSort(nums: number[]): number[] {
  // find out the min value, and do a map to keep all numbers are positive
  const min = Math.min(...nums);
  let mapper = min < 0 ? Math.abs(0 - min) : 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    nums[i] = nums[i] + mapper;
  }

  // counting sort beginning
  const max = Math.max(...nums);
  const countArray = new Array(max + 1).fill(0);

  // counting
  for (const item of nums) {
    countArray[item]++;
  }

  // calculate the deviate of sorted array's index
  let sum = 0;
  let temp = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < countArray.length; i++) {
    sum = sum + temp;
    temp = countArray[i];
    countArray[i] = sum;
  }

  // get sorted array
  const sortArray = new Array(nums.length).fill(0);
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    const index = countArray[nums[i]];
    const value = nums[i];
    sortArray[index] = value;
    countArray[nums[i]]++;
  }

  // remapping;
  for (let i = 0; i < sortArray.length; i++) {
    sortArray[i] = sortArray[i] - mapper;
  }

  return sortArray;
}

// test
const array = [2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, -3, -4];
const res = countingSort(array);
console.log(res);
```

It is a stable sorting algorithm. Because we make a new space and do not break the original array.

Time Complexity: O(N + K), where N is the size of the input array and K is the maximum value in the array.

Space Complexity: O(N + K), since we have to initialize a new array of size N and a counts array of size K+1.

O(N+K) is a linear time complexity, we may think it is perfect. But notice one thing: if the maximum number in the array is too big, we need to create a space as big as this number. And it is a waste of space. Like array [0, 1, 100001, 2].

So the Counting Sort is not as perfect as we thought.
